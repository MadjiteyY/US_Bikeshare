# Exploring_US_Bikeshare_Data

### OVERVIEW 
I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States, namely, Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The catchy part of this project is the interactive experience portrayed in a few lines of code. I wrote a script that takes in raw input from a user to create an interactive experience in answering interesting questions about the dataset by computing descriptive statistics. The scripts allow a user to filter the data by city, month and day.

For example, a user can request information for any of the three cities by inputting the city name, a day and month. 
The user's input will provide the following information or statistics:

#1 Popular times of travel

* most common month

* most common day of week

* most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

* most common start station

* most common end station

* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

* total travel time

* average travel time

#4 User info

* counts of each user type

* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)

* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)

* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)

* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)

* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)

* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)

* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

* Gender

* Birth Year
